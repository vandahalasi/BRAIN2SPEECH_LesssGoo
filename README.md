## BRAIN2SPEECH Project ##
The aim of this project is to generate audio files based on brain signes using Machine Learning based algorithms. We are using the following [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01542-9) as a reference. The preprocessing steps such as filtering and channel selection have been taken from their work, which can be found in [SingleWordProductionDutch](https://github.com/vandahalasi/BRAIN2SPEECH_LesssGoo/SingleWordProductionDutch) submodule.
